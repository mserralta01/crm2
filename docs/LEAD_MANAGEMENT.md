# Lead Management Feature Documentation

## Overview

The Lead Management feature provides a comprehensive interface for sales teams to manage and track individual leads. The interface is divided into two main sections:

1. Lead Profile (Left Column)
2. Activities Management (Right Column)

All lead data is persisted in Firebase Firestore, providing real-time storage and retrieval capabilities. See [IMPLEMENTATION.md](./IMPLEMENTATION.md) for implementation details.

## Data Architecture

### Lead Data Model

The Lead data model is defined in `data/leads.ts` and includes:

```typescript
export interface Lead {
  id: number;
  name: string;
  company: string;
  email: string;
  phone: string;
  status: string;
  value: string;
  position: number;
  createdAt: string;
  lastActivity: string;
  activities: {
    calls: Activity[];
    notes: Activity[];
    emails: Activity[];
    meetings: Activity[];
    documents: Activity[];
  };
}
```

This model is used throughout the application to ensure type safety and consistent data structure.

### Firestore Integration

Lead data is stored in Firestore with the following considerations:
- Document IDs are used as unique identifiers
- Timestamps are stored as Firestore Timestamp objects
- Activities are stored as nested collections
- Position field is used for Kanban view ordering

## Views and Interfaces

### List View

The List View (`components/leads/leads-table.tsx`) provides a tabular representation of leads with:
- Sortable columns
- Status filtering
- Search functionality
- Quick actions

### Kanban View

The Kanban View (`components/leads/leads-kanban.tsx`) offers a visual pipeline representation with:
- Drag-and-drop status updates
- Position tracking within status columns
- Summary statistics
- Visual status indicators
- Robust error handling for database operations
- Diagnostic tools for identifying problematic data

Key improvements in the Kanban view include:
1. Document existence verification before updates
2. Graceful error recovery during drag operations
3. Filtering of problematic leads from the UI
4. Safe data conversion with comprehensive null checks

### Detail View

The Detail View (`components/leads/lead-page-client.tsx`) provides a comprehensive interface for:
- Viewing and editing lead information
- Managing activities
- Tracking communication history
- Uploading and managing documents

## Architecture

### Page Structure

```
/dashboard/leads/[id]/
├── Lead Profile Section (Left)
│   ├── Basic Information
│   ├── Contact Details
│   ├── Status & Value
│   └── Timeline
└── Activities Section (Right)
    ├── Phone Calls
    ├── Notes
    ├── Email
    ├── Meetings
    └── Documents
```

### Components

1. `LeadPage` (`app/dashboard/leads/[id]/page.tsx`)
   - Main container component
   - Handles metadata and layout

2. `LeadPageClient` (`components/leads/lead-page-client.tsx`)
   - Fetches lead data from Firestore
   - Manages loading and error states
   - Handles layout and data display

3. `LeadProfile` (`components/leads/lead-profile.tsx`)
   - Displays lead information
   - Contact details
   - Status and deal value
   - Quick action buttons

4. `LeadActivities` (`components/leads/lead-activities.tsx`)
   - Fetches lead data independently
   - Manages different activity types
   - Handles activity creation and display
   - Tab-based interface for different activities
   - Empty state handling for each activity type
