# Lead Management Feature Documentation

## Overview

The Lead Management feature provides a comprehensive interface for sales teams to manage and track individual leads. The interface is divided into two main sections:

1. Lead Profile (Left Column)
2. Activities Management (Right Column)

All lead data is persisted in Firebase Firestore, providing real-time storage and retrieval capabilities. See [IMPLEMENTATION.md](./IMPLEMENTATION.md) for implementation details and [NOTE_SYSTEM.md](./NOTE_SYSTEM.md) for details on the enhanced notes system.

## Data Architecture

### Lead Data Model

The Lead data model is defined in `data/leads.ts` and includes:

```typescript
export interface Lead {
  id: string;
  numericId: number;
  firstName: string;
  lastName: string;
  company: string;
  email: string;
  phone: string;
  status: string;
  value: string;
  position: number;
  createdAt: string;
  lastActivity: string;
  
  // Address information
  address?: string;
  city?: string;
  state?: string;
  zipCode?: string;
  country?: string;
  
  // Lead source information
  source?: string;
  referredBy?: string;
  campaign?: string;
  
  // Tags for better organization
  tags?: string[];
  
  // Custom fields for flexible data collection
  customFields?: Array<{key: string, value: string}>;
  
  // Social media profiles
  socialProfiles?: {
    linkedin?: string;
    twitter?: string;
    facebook?: string;
    instagram?: string;
  };
  
  // Business details
  website?: string;
  industry?: string;
  companySize?: string;
  annualRevenue?: string;
  
  // Lead preferences and requirements
  budget?: string;
  timeline?: string;
  preferredContact?: string;
  keyRequirements?: string;
  
  activities: {
    calls: Activity[];
    notes: Activity[];
    emails: Activity[];
    meetings: Activity[];
    documents: Activity[];
  };
}
```

This enhanced model is used throughout the application to ensure type safety and consistent data structure, providing rich information for small business owners, internet marketers, and coaches.

### Firestore Integration

Lead data is stored in Firestore with the following considerations:
- Document IDs are used as unique identifiers
- Timestamps are stored as Firestore Timestamp objects
- Activities are stored as nested collections
- Position field is used for Kanban view ordering
- Optional fields are omitted when empty to optimize storage

## Views and Interfaces

### List View

The List View (`components/leads/leads-table.tsx`) provides a tabular representation of leads with:
- Sortable columns
- Status filtering
- Search functionality
- Quick actions

### Kanban View

The Kanban View (`components/leads/leads-kanban.tsx`) offers a visual pipeline representation with:
- Drag-and-drop status updates
- Position tracking within status columns
- Summary statistics
- Visual status indicators
- Robust error handling for database operations
- Diagnostic tools for identifying problematic data

Key improvements in the Kanban view include:
1. Document existence verification before updates
2. Graceful error recovery during drag operations
3. Filtering of problematic leads from the UI
4. Safe data conversion with comprehensive null checks

### Detail View

The Detail View (`components/leads/lead-page-client.tsx`) provides a comprehensive interface for:
- Viewing and editing lead information
- Managing activities
- Tracking communication history
- Uploading and managing documents
- Deleting leads with confirmation dialog

   - Safe data conversion
   - Detailed error logging
   - Graceful failure handling

2. **UI Layer**
   - Loading states
   - Error messages
   - Empty states
   - Fallback content
   - Diagnostic tools
   - Operation feedback (delete/edit in progress)

3. **Kanban View**
   - Problematic lead identification
   - Filtering of problematic data
   - Graceful recovery from drag operation failures
   - Data refresh on error

## Lead Deletion Workflow

The lead deletion feature follows a careful workflow to prevent accidental data loss:

1. **Trigger**: User clicks the "Delete Lead" button in the lead profile section
2. **Confirmation**: An alert dialog appears asking for confirmation
3. **Processing**: Upon confirmation, a loading state is displayed on the button
4. **API Call**: The `deleteLead` function is called with the lead ID
5. **Feedback**: Success or error toast notification is displayed
6. **Redirection**: On success, user is redirected to the leads list page
7. **Error Recovery**: On failure, the delete button is re-enabled for retry

The implementation uses the following technologies:
- Shadcn UI Alert Dialog for the confirmation interface
- React state for managing the delete operation status
- Firebase Firestore `deleteDoc` function for database operation
- React Toast for operation feedback
- Next.js router for redirection after successful deletion

## Best Practices

1. **Data Management**
   - Real-time updates
   - Optimistic UI updates
   - Error handling

   - Optimized image loading
   - Minimal re-renders

3. **Accessibility**

   - Screen reader support
   - Proper focus management in dialogs

4. **User Experience**
