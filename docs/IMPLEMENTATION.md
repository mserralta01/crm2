# Firebase Implementation Documentation

## Overview

This document details the implementation of real data functionality in the SalesPro CRM application using Firebase services. The implementation connects the frontend UI components to Firestore database and Firebase Storage, enabling persistent storage and retrieval of customer relationship data.

## Implementation Structure

The Firebase implementation is organized into the following components:

1. **Services Layer** - Core functionality for interacting with Firebase services
2. **API Endpoints** - RESTful API routes for client-server interaction
3. **UI Integration** - Updated UI components to work with real data
4. **Utility Functions** - Helper functions for data formatting and processing

## Services Layer

The services layer consists of modular TypeScript files that encapsulate Firebase interactions:

### 1. Lead Service (`lib/services/leads-service.ts`)

This service handles all lead-related operations with Firestore:

```typescript
// Core functions:
export async function getLeads(): Promise<Lead[]>
export async function getLeadById(id: string): Promise<Lead | null>
export async function getLeadsByStatus(status: string): Promise<Lead[]>
export async function createLead(leadData: Omit<Lead, 'id'>): Promise<string>
export async function updateLead(id: string, leadData: Partial<Lead>): Promise<void>
export async function deleteLead(id: string): Promise<void>
export async function addActivityToLead(leadId: string, activityType, activityData): Promise<void>
export async function updateLeadPositions(updates: { id: string; position: number }[]): Promise<void>
export async function identifyProblematicLeads(): Promise<string[]>
```

Key features:
- Firebase document converter for type-safe Lead object conversion
- Proper handling of complex nested activity data
- Timestamp conversion for date fields
- Error handling and logging
- Robust null checking and data validation
- Document existence verification before updates

#### Delete Lead Implementation

The `deleteLead` function performs the following operations:
1. Verifies that the lead document exists before attempting deletion
2. Uses Firebase's `deleteDoc` function to remove the document
3. Implements error handling with detailed logging
4. Returns a Promise that resolves when deletion is complete or rejects with error details

```typescript
export async function deleteLead(id: string): Promise<void> {
  try {
    // Reference to the lead document
    const leadRef = doc(db, LEADS_COLLECTION, id);
    
    // First verify the document exists
    const docSnap = await getDoc(leadRef);
    if (!docSnap.exists()) {
      throw new Error(`Lead with ID ${id} does not exist`);
    }
    
    // Delete the document
    await deleteDoc(leadRef);
    console.log(`Successfully deleted lead ${id}`);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error deleting lead:', error);
    throw error;
  }
}
```

### 2. Storage Service (`lib/services/storage-service.ts`)

This service manages file uploads and retrieval from Firebase Storage:

```typescript
// Core functions:
export async function uploadFile(file: File, path: string): Promise<string>
export async function uploadLeadDocument(leadId: string, file: File): Promise<string>
export async function deleteFile(fileUrl: string): Promise<void>
export async function getFileUrlWithToken(filePath: string): Promise<string>
```

Key features:
- Secure path generation for uploaded files
- File name sanitization
- URL retrieval for uploaded files
- Error handling for upload failures

## API Endpoints

RESTful API endpoints were implemented to provide a clean interface between the client UI and Firebase services:

### 1. Leads API

- `GET /api/leads` - Retrieve all leads
- `POST /api/leads` - Create a new lead
- `GET /api/leads/[id]` - Get a specific lead by ID
- `PATCH /api/leads/[id]` - Update a specific lead
- `DELETE /api/leads/[id]` - Delete a specific lead
- `POST /api/leads/[id]/activities` - Add an activity to a lead
- `GET /api/leads/count` - Get the count of leads (used for seeding checks)

#### Delete Lead API Endpoint

The DELETE endpoint for leads is implemented in `app/api/leads/[id]/route.ts`:

```typescript
// DELETE /api/leads/[id] - Delete a lead
export async function DELETE(
  request: NextRequest,
  { params }: { params: { id: string } }
): Promise<NextResponse> {
  try {
    await deleteLead(params.id);
    
    return NextResponse.json({ message: 'Lead deleted successfully' });
  } catch (error: any) {
    console.error('Error deleting lead:', error);
    return NextResponse.json(
      { error: 'Failed to delete lead', message: error.message },
      { status: 500 }
    );
  }
}
```

This endpoint:
1. Takes the lead ID from the URL parameters
2. Calls the `deleteLead` service function
3. Returns a success message upon completion
4. Handles errors and returns appropriate HTTP status codes
5. Includes detailed error messages for debugging

### 2. Upload API

- `POST /api/uploads` - Upload a file to Firebase Storage
- `OPTIONS /api/uploads` - CORS pre-flight handling for uploads

All API endpoints include:
- Proper error handling and status codes
- Input validation
- Descriptive error messages
- JSON response formatting

## UI Integration

The following UI components were updated to work with real data:

### 1. Dashboard Page (`app/dashboard/page.tsx`)

- Fetches and displays real-time lead statistics
- Calculates metrics (total leads, conversion rate, revenue)
- Shows recent lead activity with relative timestamps
- Implements loading and error states

### 2. Leads Table (`components/leads/leads-table.tsx`)

- Fetches lead data from Firebase on component mount
- Implements client-side filtering and sorting
- Provides lead editing and deletion functionality
- Shows loading states during data fetch

### 3. Lead Profile (`components/leads/lead-profile.tsx`)

- Displays complete lead information
- Provides edit capabilities with validation
- Implements lead deletion with confirmation
- Shows visual feedback during operations
- Handles error states gracefully
- Redirects upon successful edit or delete

#### Delete Lead UI Implementation

The delete lead functionality in the UI:
1. Uses the AlertDialog component from Shadcn UI for confirmation
2. Implements loading state with the isDeleting React state
3. Disables the delete button during the operation to prevent multiple clicks
4. Uses toast notifications for operation feedback
5. Redirects to the leads list page upon successful deletion
6. Recovers gracefully from errors and allows retry
7. Follows accessibility best practices for confirmation dialogs

```tsx
// Delete lead handler in LeadProfile component
const handleDelete = async () => {
  try {
    setIsDeleting(true);
    await deleteLead(lead.id);
    
    toast({
      title: "Success",
      description: "Lead has been deleted successfully.",
    });
    
    // Redirect to leads list after deletion
    router.push('/dashboard/leads');
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error deleting lead:', error);
    
    toast({
      title: "Error",
      description: "Failed to delete the lead. Please try again.",
      variant: "destructive",
    });
    setIsDeleting(false);
  }
};
```

## Security Considerations

The implementation includes several security measures:

1. **Authentication Requirements**
   - All API endpoints require authenticated users
