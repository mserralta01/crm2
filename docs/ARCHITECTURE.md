## Key Components and Services

### Authentication Flow

The application uses Firebase Authentication for user management:

1. **Sign Up**: Users create accounts with email/password
2. **Sign In**: Authentication with email/password 
3. **Profile Management**: Users can update profile information
4. **Role-Based Access Control**: Different user roles (admin, manager, agent)

### Data Flow Architecture

The application follows a layered architecture for data operations:

1. **UI Layer**: React components in `/components`
2. **API Layer**: Next.js API routes in `/app/api`
3. **Service Layer**: Services in `/lib/services` that handle business logic
4. **Data Access Layer**: Firebase interaction in service functions
5. **Database**: Firestore collections and documents

This architecture has been fully implemented with real data persistence. The application now uses Firebase Firestore for data storage and Firebase Storage for file uploads. All components have been updated to fetch and display real data. For implementation details, see [IMPLEMENTATION.md](./IMPLEMENTATION.md).

### State Management

State is managed using a combination of:

1. **React State**: For component-level state
2. **React Context**: For shared state across components (auth state, theme, etc.)
3. **Server Components**: Data fetching at the server level
4. **Custom Hooks**: Encapsulating complex state logic

## Database Design

The application uses Firestore as its primary database, with the following collections:

### Users Collection
Store user profile information beyond what Firebase Authentication provides:
```
users/{userId}
```

### Leads Collection
Stores information about sales leads:
```
leads/{leadId}
```

### Activities Collection
Stores activities related to leads (calls, emails, meetings, notes, etc.):
```
activities/{activityId}
```

### Companies Collection
Stores information about companies:
```
companies/{companyId}
```

## Authentication and Authorization

### Authentication
- Firebase Authentication handles user registration, login, and password management
- Supporting authentication methods:
  - Email/password
  - Google OAuth (planned)

### Authorization
- Role-based access control using custom claims in Firebase Auth
- Firestore Security Rules enforce access control at the database level
- Frontend route guards prevent unauthorized access to protected routes

## Key Workflows

### Lead Management
1. Lead creation
2. Lead qualification
3. Managing lead activities
4. Lead conversion
5. Lead analytics

### Activity Tracking
1. Logging calls
2. Adding notes
3. Scheduling meetings
4. Sending emails
5. Uploading documents

### User Management
1. User registration
2. Role assignment
3. Team management
4. Activity monitoring

## Security Considerations

### Data Security
- All data is stored in Firestore with security rules
- Sensitive information is protected by Firebase Authentication
- File uploads are secured with Firebase Storage security rules

### Application Security
- Environment variables for sensitive configuration
- HTTPS-only access
- Content Security Policy (CSP) configuration
- Regular security audits

## Performance Optimizations

### Frontend Optimizations
- Static generation for non-dynamic pages
- Incremental Static Regeneration for semi-dynamic content
- Code splitting and lazy loading
- Optimized images and assets

### Backend Optimizations
- Efficient Firestore queries with proper indexing
- Caching strategies for frequently accessed data
- Rate limiting for API endpoints
- Optimistic UI updates

## Deployment Architecture

The application is deployed using:
- **Vercel/Netlify**: For hosting the Next.js application
- **Firebase**: For backend services
- **GitHub Actions**: For CI/CD pipelines (optional)

## Integration Points

### External Services
- **Email Service (SendGrid)**: For sending transactional emails
- **Calendar Integration**: For scheduling meetings (planned)
- **File Storage**: Firebase Storage for document management

### API Integrations
- **CRM Data Import/Export**: For integration with existing systems
- **Analytics Tools**: For business intelligence

## Monitoring and Logging

- **Firebase Analytics**: For user behavior tracking
- **Firebase Performance Monitoring**: For application performance
- **Error Tracking**: For exception monitoring and reporting
- **Audit Logs**: For security and compliance

## Future Architecture Considerations

- **Real-time Collaboration**: Using Firestore's real-time capabilities
- **Offline Support**: Using Firebase's offline capabilities
- **Mobile Application**: Potential React Native application sharing the Firebase backend
- **AI-Powered Features**: Integrating machine learning for predictive analytics
- **Workflow Automation**: Rules-based automation for common tasks

## Development Guidelines

### Code Organization
- Feature-based organization for components and logic
- Shared UI components in the `ui` directory
- Business logic separated into services

### Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for utility functions and hooks
- Component tests for UI components
- Integration tests for key workflows
- E2E tests for critical user journeys

### State Management Guidelines
- Use React state for simple component state
- Use React Context for shared state across components
- Use custom hooks for complex state logic
- Prefer server components for data fetching when possible

### Firebase Usage Best Practices
- Batch operations for multiple writes
- Use transactions for atomic operations
- Efficient querying with proper indexing
- Security rules testing and validation

## Conclusion

This architecture provides a scalable and maintainable foundation for our CRM application. The combination of Next.js and Firebase offers a powerful platform for building feature-rich applications with minimal operational overhead.
