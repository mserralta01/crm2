## Architecture

For detailed information about the application architecture, please refer to [ARCHITECTURE.md](./ARCHITECTURE.md).

Key architectural aspects include:
- Next.js App Router structure
- Firebase backend services
- Layered architecture for data operations
- State management approach
- Authentication and authorization
- Database design
- Security considerations

## Firebase Integration

For detailed information about the Firebase integration, please refer to [FIREBASE.md](./FIREBASE.md).

SalesPro CRM uses Firebase for:
- User authentication and management
- Data storage with Firestore
- File storage with Firebase Storage
- Usage tracking with Firebase Analytics

## Layout System

The application uses a dual-layout system to provide different experiences for marketing and dashboard sections:

### Marketing Layout
- Full navigation menu with links to features, pricing, etc.
- Footer with company information and links
- Shown on all public pages (/, /pricing, /auth/*)
- Optimized for conversion and information presentation

### Dashboard Layout
- Dedicated sidebar navigation
- No top navigation or marketing footer
- Custom header for each section
- Optimized for productivity and data management

The layout switching is handled automatically based on the current route:
```typescript
// app/layout.tsx
const isDashboard = typeof window !== 'undefined' 
  ? window.location.pathname.startsWith('/dashboard')
  : false;

// Only show marketing navigation and footer on non-dashboard pages
{!isDashboard && <Navigation />}
{!isDashboard && <Footer />}
```

## Components

### Marketing Components

The marketing site components focus on conversion and information presentation:

- Hero Section: Animated headline and compelling visuals
- Problem Section: Highlights common CRM pain points
- Comparison Section: Feature comparison with competitors
- Testimonials: Social proof from existing customers

### Dashboard Components

The dashboard interface prioritizes efficiency and data management:

- Sidebar Navigation: Quick access to all sections
- Stats Cards: Key metrics and performance indicators
- Data Tables: Efficient data presentation and management
- Action Buttons: Common tasks and operations

## Styling Guide

### Color System

The application uses a sophisticated color system with CSS variables for theming:

```css
:root {
  --primary: 221.2 83.2% 53.3%;
  --accent: 262.1 83.3% 57.8%;
  /* ... other color variables */
}
```

### Gradient Effects

Custom gradient utilities for text and backgrounds:

```css
.gradient-bg {
  background: linear-gradient(
    135deg,
    hsl(var(--primary)) 0%,
    hsl(var(--accent)) 100%
  );
}
```

## Animation System

### Framer Motion Integration

The project uses Framer Motion for smooth, performant animations:

- Page transitions
- Scroll-triggered animations
- Hover effects
- Staggered animations

Example configuration:

```typescript
const containerVariants = {
  hidden: {},
  visible: {
    transition: {
      staggerChildren: 0.1
    }
  }
};
```
