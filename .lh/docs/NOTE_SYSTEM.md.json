The system supports unlimited notes for each lead with advanced pinning capabilities to highlight important information.\n\n## Key Features\n\n### 1.

Pin System\n- **Pin Important Notes**: Click the pin icon to highlight critical information\n- **Visual Indicators**: Pinned notes have:\n  - Light yellow background\n  - Amber-colored border\n  - \"PINNED\" label badge\n  - Persistent pin icon\n- **Automatic Sorting**: Pinned notes always appear at the top of the list\n\n### 3. Database Integration\n- **Real-time Saving**: All notes are immediately saved to the database\n- **Persistent Storage**: Notes remain available after page refreshes or navigation\n- **Timestamp Tracking**: Each note records exact date and time of creation\n- **Customer Association**: Notes are properly linked to specific leads\n\n## How to Use the Notes Feature\n\n### Creating Notes\n1.
