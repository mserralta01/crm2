            "content": "# Application Architecture\n\n## Overview\n\nThis document outlines the architecture of our CRM (Customer Relationship Management) application, which is built with Next.js and Firebase. The application provides a comprehensive platform for managing customer relationships, leads, and sales activities.\n\n## Technology Stack\n\n### Frontend\n- **Next.js**: React framework for server-rendered applications\n- **React**: UI library for building component-based user interfaces\n- **TypeScript**: For type-safe code\n- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework for styling\n- **Shadcn/UI**: Component library based on Radix UI primitives\n- **Lucide React**: Icon library\n- **React Hook Form**: Form handling\n- **Zod**: Schema validation\n\n### Backend/Infrastructure\n- **Firebase**: Cloud-based platform for backend services\n  - **Authentication**: User management\n  - **Firestore**: NoSQL database\n  - **Storage**: File storage\n  - **Analytics**: Usage tracking\n- **Next.js API Routes**: For server-side functionality (when needed)\n- **SendGrid**: For email functionality\n\n## Application Structure\n\n```\n/\n├── app/                # Next.js App Router\n│   ├── api/            # API routes\n│   ├── auth/           # Authentication pages\n│   ├── dashboard/      # Dashboard pages\n│   │   ├── leads/      # Lead management\n│   │   ├── contacts/   # Contact management\n│   │   ├── activities/ # Activity tracking\n│   │   └── settings/   # User settings\n│   └── layout.tsx      # Root layout\n├── components/         # Reusable React components\n│   ├── ui/             # UI components from shadcn/ui\n│   ├── leads/          # Lead-specific components\n│   ├── activities/     # Activity-specific components\n│   ├── auth/           # Authentication components\n│   └── shared/         # Shared components\n├── lib/                # Utility functions and services\n│   ├── firebase.ts     # Firebase configuration and services\n│   └── utils.ts        # Utility functions\n├── hooks/              # Custom React hooks\n├── data/               # Data models and API functions\n│   ├── schema/         # Zod schemas for data validation\n│   ├── services/       # Service layer for data operations\n│   └── api/            # API client functions\n├── public/             # Static assets\n├── styles/             # Global styles\n├── docs/               # Documentation\n└── types/              # TypeScript type definitions\n```\n\n## Key Components and Services\n\n### Authentication Flow\n\nThe application uses Firebase Authentication for user management:\n\n1. **Sign Up**: Users create accounts with email/password\n2. **Sign In**: Authentication with email/password \n3. **Profile Management**: Users can update profile information\n4. **Role-Based Access Control**: Different user roles (admin, manager, agent)\n\n### Data Flow Architecture\n\nThe application follows a layered architecture for data operations:\n\n1. **UI Layer**: React components in `/components`\n2. **Service Layer**: Services in `/data/services` that handle business logic\n3. **Data Access Layer**: Firebase interaction in service functions\n4. **Database**: Firestore collections and documents\n\n### State Management\n\nState is managed using a combination of:\n\n1. **React State**: For component-level state\n2. **React Context**: For shared state across components (auth state, theme, etc.)\n3. **Server Components**: Data fetching at the server level\n4. **Custom Hooks**: Encapsulating complex state logic\n\n## Database Design\n\nThe application uses Firestore as its primary database, with the following collections:\n\n### Users Collection\nStore user profile information beyond what Firebase Authentication provides:\n```\nusers/{userId}\n```\n\n### Leads Collection\nStores information about sales leads:\n```\nleads/{leadId}\n```\n\n### Activities Collection\nStores activities related to leads (calls, emails, meetings, notes, etc.):\n```\nactivities/{activityId}\n```\n\n### Companies Collection\nStores information about companies:\n```\ncompanies/{companyId}\n```\n\n## Authentication and Authorization\n\n### Authentication\n- Firebase Authentication handles user registration, login, and password management\n- Supporting authentication methods:\n  - Email/password\n  - Google OAuth (planned)\n\n### Authorization\n- Role-based access control using custom claims in Firebase Auth\n- Firestore Security Rules enforce access control at the database level\n- Frontend route guards prevent unauthorized access to protected routes\n\n## Key Workflows\n\n### Lead Management\n1. Lead creation\n2. Lead qualification\n3. Managing lead activities\n4. Lead conversion\n5. Lead analytics\n\n### Activity Tracking\n1. Logging calls\n2. Adding notes\n3. Scheduling meetings\n4. Sending emails\n5. Uploading documents\n\n### User Management\n1. User registration\n2. Role assignment\n3. Team management\n4. Activity monitoring\n\n## Security Considerations\n\n### Data Security\n- All data is stored in Firestore with security rules\n- Sensitive information is protected by Firebase Authentication\n- File uploads are secured with Firebase Storage security rules\n\n### Application Security\n- Environment variables for sensitive configuration\n- HTTPS-only access\n- Content Security Policy (CSP) configuration\n- Regular security audits\n\n## Performance Optimizations\n\n### Frontend Optimizations\n- Static generation for non-dynamic pages\n- Incremental Static Regeneration for semi-dynamic content\n- Code splitting and lazy loading\n- Optimized images and assets\n\n### Backend Optimizations\n- Efficient Firestore queries with proper indexing\n- Caching strategies for frequently accessed data\n- Rate limiting for API endpoints\n- Optimistic UI updates\n\n## Deployment Architecture\n\nThe application is deployed using:\n- **Vercel/Netlify**: For hosting the Next.js application\n- **Firebase**: For backend services\n- **GitHub Actions**: For CI/CD pipelines (optional)\n\n## Integration Points\n\n### External Services\n- **Email Service (SendGrid)**: For sending transactional emails\n- **Calendar Integration**: For scheduling meetings (planned)\n- **File Storage**: Firebase Storage for document management\n\n### API Integrations\n- **CRM Data Import/Export**: For integration with existing systems\n- **Analytics Tools**: For business intelligence\n\n## Monitoring and Logging\n\n- **Firebase Analytics**: For user behavior tracking\n- **Firebase Performance Monitoring**: For application performance\n- **Error Tracking**: For exception monitoring and reporting\n- **Audit Logs**: For security and compliance\n\n## Future Architecture Considerations\n\n- **Real-time Collaboration**: Using Firestore's real-time capabilities\n- **Offline Support**: Using Firebase's offline capabilities\n- **Mobile Application**: Potential React Native application sharing the Firebase backend\n- **AI-Powered Features**: Integrating machine learning for predictive analytics\n- **Workflow Automation**: Rules-based automation for common tasks\n\n## Development Guidelines\n\n### Code Organization\n- Feature-based organization for components and logic\n- Shared UI components in the `ui` directory\n- Business logic separated into services\n\n### Testing Strategy\n- Unit tests for utility functions and hooks\n- Component tests for UI components\n- Integration tests for key workflows\n- E2E tests for critical user journeys\n\n### State Management Guidelines\n- Use React state for simple component state\n- Use React Context for shared state across components\n- Use custom hooks for complex state logic\n- Prefer server components for data fetching when possible\n\n### Firebase Usage Best Practices\n- Batch operations for multiple writes\n- Use transactions for atomic operations\n- Efficient querying with proper indexing\n- Security rules testing and validation\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThis architecture provides a scalable and maintainable foundation for our CRM application. The combination of Next.js and Firebase offers a powerful platform for building feature-rich applications with minimal operational overhead. "
